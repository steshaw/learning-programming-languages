    <h1>q and cite examples</h1>

    Some examples from the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-q-element">HTML Living Standard</a>.

    <div class="example">Here is a simple example of the use of the q element:

      <p>The man said <q>Things that are impossible just take
      longer</q>. I disagreed with him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">Here is an example with both an explicit citation link
      in the q element, and an explicit citation outside:

      <p>The W3C page <cite>About W3C</cite> says the W3C's
      mission is <q cite="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">To lead the
      World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and
      guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web</q>. I
      disagree with this mission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">In the following example, the quotation itself 
      contains a quotation:

      <p>In <cite>Example One</cite>, he writes <q>The man
      said <q>Things that are impossible just take longer</q>. I
      disagreed with him</q>. Well, I disagree even more!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      In the following example, quotation marks are used instead of the q element:

      Firstly, heavy double quotation marks:

      <p>His best argument was ❝I disagree❞, which I thought was laughable.</p>

      Secondly, normal double quotation marks:

      <p>He said “What?”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      In the following example, there is no quote — the quotation marks are used to name a word. Use of the q element in this case would be inappropriate.


      <p>The word "ineffable" could have been used to describe the disaster
      resulting from the campaign's mismanagement.</p>
    </div>
